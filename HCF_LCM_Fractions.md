<!-- Solutions
Part A: Highest Common Factor (HCF)

HCF of 12 and 18 = 6
HCF of 24 and 36 = 12
HCF of 15 and 25 = 5
HCF of 8 and 20 = 4
HCF of 6 and 9 = 3
HCF of 10 and 15 = 5
HCF of 9, 12, and 15 = 3

Part B: Least Common Multiple (LCM)

LCM of 4 and 6 = 12
LCM of 5 and 10 = 10
LCM of 7 and 14 = 14
LCM of 3 and 4 = 12
LCM of 2 and 10 = 10
LCM of 6 and 9 = 18
LCM of 3, 4, and 6 = 12

Part C: Fractions
Basic Fraction Problems

1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4
3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2
2/5 = 0.4 and 1/3 = 0.33... So 2/5 is larger than 1/3
2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 of the chocolate bar is left

Fraction Problems Using LCM

LCM of 3 and 6 is 6
1/3 = 2/6
1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
LCM of 4 and 2 is 4
1/2 = 2/4
1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
LCM of 8 and 6 is 24
3/8 = 9/24
2/6 = 8/24
9/24 is larger than 8/24, so 3/8 is larger than 2/6
LCM of 5 and 10 is 10
2/5 = 4/10
4/10 + 1/10 = 5/10 = 1/2
LCM of 4 and 8 is 8
3/4 = 6/8
6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8
Which fraction is larger?
a) 1/2 is larger than 1/4
b) 2/3 = 0.667..., 3/5 = 0.6, so 2/3 is larger
c) 3/8 = 0.375, 1/2 = 0.5, so 1/2 is larger
Add the following fractions:
a) 1/4 + 1/8 = 2/8 + 1/8 = 3/8
b) 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
c) 3/10 + 1/5 = 3/10 + 2/10 = 5/10 = 1/2
Subtract the following fractions:
a) 3/4 - 1/2 = 6/8 - 4/8 = 2/8 = 1/4
b) 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
c) 7/8 - 1/4 = 7/8 - 2/8 = 5/8

Part D: Word Problems (HCF)

HCF of 8 and 12 is 4, so Sam can make 4 groups.
HCF of 15 and 20 is 5, so Ms. Johnson can create 5 teams.

Part E: Word Problems (LCM)

LCM of 15 and 45 is 45, so the bells will next ring together at 9:45 AM.
LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, so Maya will practice both instruments on the same day again after 12 days.

Part F: Mixed Problems

1/4 + 2/8 = 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2 of the pizza.
LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12, so they will all jump together again after 12 seconds.
HCF of 32 and 24 is 8, so the teacher can make 8 gift bags.
HCF of 24 and 18 is 6, so Tom can build 6 fence sections.
LCM of 6 and 8 is 24, so the lights will flash together again after 24 seconds.
LCM of 2, 3, and 4 is 12, so they will all water their plants on the same day again after 12 days.
HCF of 30 and 45 is 15, so Emma can use 15 vases.
2/3 - 1/6 = 4/6 - 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2 of the chocolate bar is left. -->
