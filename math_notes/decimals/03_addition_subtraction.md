## Topic 4: Addition and Subtraction of Decimal Numbers

### Class Notes

**Rules for Adding and Subtracting Decimals:**

1. **Align the decimal points** vertically
2. **Add zeros** if needed to make the numbers have the same number of decimal places
3. **Add or subtract** as you would with whole numbers
4. **Place the decimal point** in the answer directly below the decimal points in the problem

**Examples:**

**Addition Example:** $25.47 + 8.9 + 0.635$

### In-Class Exercise 4

**Part A:** Calculate:

1. $15.6 + 9.24$ →
   <br><br>
2. $32.45 - 18.7$ →
   <br><br>
3. $7.8 + 12.35 + 4.067$ →

**Part B:** Word Problems

1. Sarah bought items costing **$12.45**, **$8.75**, and **$15.30**. How much did she spend in total?
